## Parts

These examples were done using a regular low-cost [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/) board connected to a Linux computer via USB.

The Code running on the Pico was created with [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/), using the Arduino framework. Opening up this repo with PlatformIO should auto-install all required dependencies. Compiled binaries will also be provided.
